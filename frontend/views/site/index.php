                        Information and systems must be available at all times. Stakeholders currently expect information and systems to be accessible whenever they need. The availability of IT services becomes a high priority and strategic issue because there is growing evidence of stakeholders frustration when information and systems are inaccessible. More that 70% of IT managers think that availability must be considered beyond IT infrastructure issue. 

                        In Rialachas, we can help your organization to develop the management process that identifies potential impacts that threaten an organisation and provides a framework for building resilience and the capability for an effective response which safeguards the interests of key stakeholders, reputation, brand and value creating activities.

                        We can help you to develop Business continuity planning (BCP), a formalized set of documents that identifies an organization exposure to threats - both internal and external, and synthesizes assets to provide effective prevention and recovery for the organization, while maintaining competitive advantage and value system integrity.

                        It is clear that business value from IT investments cannot be realized by IT, but will always be created on the business side. This realization that the involvement of business is crucial initiated a shift in the definition toward enterprise governance of IT. 

                        Governance of enterprise IT is an integral part of corporate governance and addresses the definition and implementation of processes, structures and relational mechanisms in the organizations that enable both business and IT people to execute their responsibilities in support of business-IT alignment and the creation of business value from IT-enabled investments. COBIT and ISO 38500 has helped clarify governance of enterprise IT by describing it as the management system used by directors. 

                        In order to be competitive, your organization needs flexible and responsive enterprise IT. In Rialachas we could help you to realize effective governance of enterprise IT. We utilize our assets in form of intellectual capital and experiences in IT consultancy services along with industry leading practices to assist your organization in establishing the governance of enterprise IT.
